To run the visualization, you need to have MATLAB R2018a installed (other versions may work but the program is developed in R2018a).

Toolbox required: 
Curve Fitting Toolbox                                 Version 3.5.7       (R2018a)
Image Processing Toolbox                              Version 10.2        (R2018a)

Follow MATLAB's prompt if addtional toolboxes need to be installed. 

After opening main.m in MATLAB, hit Run to run the script. Then pick your desired picture in the "pictures" folder. 
Only some of the two blades boomerangs will work now. Other pictures are for experimental purposes.

Some parameters may be customized at the beginning of the code.
